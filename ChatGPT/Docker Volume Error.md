docker: invalid spec: ::ro: empty section between colons.

## Answer
The error `invalid spec: ::ro: empty section between colons` occurs because Docker expects a valid mount specification in the `-v` or `--volume` flag, and it seems like one of the environment variables (`$XAUTH`, `$XSOCK`, or `$nvidia_icd_json`) is not set or is empty, resulting in an empty section between the colons.

To troubleshoot this, ensure that all the environment variables used in the `-v` options are properly set before running the Docker command. You can check them by echoing each variable:

```bash
echo $XAUTH
echo $XSOCK
echo $nvidia_icd_json
```

If any of these echo statements return nothing, you'll need to set the variable or correct the paths. If they are supposed to have values and do not, you should ensure they're being assigned properly. Once corrected, rerun the Docker command.
